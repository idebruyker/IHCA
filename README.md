# Immuno Histo Cell Analysis
## Goal

## Approach
The end-to-end process to classify and present cell components through statistics, more particularily machine learning process, including data collection, data cleanup, data classification, data analytics, machine learning modeling, model selection, prediction, and presentation. This workflow is designed to ensure a systematic and efficient approach to solving real-world problems using data.

**Summary of the Process**

* Data Collection: Gather raw data from various sources.
* Data Cleanup: Preprocess and clean the data.
* Data Classification: Understand and categorize the data.
* Data Analytics: Explore and analyze the data for insights.
* Machine Learning Modeling: Build and train models.
* Model Selection: Evaluate and select the best model.
* Prediction: Use the model to make predictions.
* Presentation: Communicate results effectively.
